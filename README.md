## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in long-context language understanding, yet they remain underexplored in handling unbounded numerical signals, such as streaming time series. Existing works either empower LLMs with time-series adaptation or infinite-length support, but seldom address both jointly. Among the primary challenges are efficient temporal pattern detection and beyond-context temporal understanding. This paper introduces **InfTS-LLM** to empower LLMs with **Inf**inite-length support and **T**ime-**S**eries adaptation, comprising two components: (1) a **Representative Detecto**r that extracts representative subsequences by identifying temporal pattern boundaries from streaming time series for pattern detection; (2) a **Pattern-guided Instructor** that constructs both prompt prefixes and representative subsequences into pattern-guided chain-of-thought inputs, and a memory pool manages representative subsequences for beyond-context understanding. Experiments on three real-world and one synthetic dataset across alignment and forecasting tasks show that InfTS-LLM outperforms five competitive baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Your role is a <<Domain>> time series analysis expert.

INPUT:
- Full Subsequence (Length: <<Fulllen>>): <<Full_Series>>
- History Subsequence (as auxiliary bases): <<Memory_Patches>>

Temporal Patterns:
- Pri-patterns: Outlier > Trend > Seasonal > Volatility (priority order).
- Sub-patterns:
  - Outlier: Sudden Spike (sharp, short-lived peak with full reversion), Level Shift (abrupt and sustained baseline change)
  - Trend: Upward (long-term increase), Downward (long-term decrease)
  - Seasonal: Fixed (stable recurring cycles), Shifting (recurring cycles with amplitude changes)
  - Volatility: Increased (rising fluctuation magnitude), Decreased (declining fluctuation magnitude)
- If plots (Representative Subsequences) are provided, use visual for temporal patterns: X-axis = time, Y-axis = values, red line = actual sequence.

Goal: Assign <<Poslen>> dominant pattern labels to each Subsequence
- Pred_Labels:
    - Assign one Pri-pattern and one Sub-pattern for each position.
    - Apply the Priority rule in case of ambiguity
- FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON only)
{
  "Pred_Labels": [("Outlier", "Sudden Spike"),...,("Volatility", "Increased")]
}

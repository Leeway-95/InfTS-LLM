Your role is a <<Domain>> time series forecaster.

The x-axis represents time, ranging from <<Start_Time>> to <<End_Time>>.
The y-axis represents the normalized <<dataset_variable>>.
The normalized <<dataset_variable>> is <<Time_Series>>.

Task: Analyze the temporal patterns in the given time series and predict the <<dataset_variable>> for the next <<PreLen>> time steps.

Quality Assurance:
- Predictions must show realistic time series dynamics with natural variability.
- Avoid over-smoothing or rigidly copying recent fluctuations.

Technical Constraints:
1. The output must strictly contain exactly <<PreLen>> values.
2. Pred_Series: An array of standard floating-point numbers with appropriate precision.
3. Do not include any extra text, explanation, or formatting outside the JSON.

FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "Pred_Series": [-0.3845145903792176, ..., -0.25595734759639727]
}

Your role is a <<Domain>> time series forecaster.

You will be provided with time series of the <<domain_variable>> observed over the past <<Histlen>> time series: <<Time_Series>>

Task: Firstly, carefully analyze the given time series and concisely summarize the main temporal change present in the time series. Then, based on this analysis, predict <<prediction_type>> for the next <<PreLen>> time periods.

Quality Assurance:
- Predictions must show realistic time series dynamics with natural variability.
- Avoid over-smoothing or rigidly copying recent fluctuations.

Technical Constraints:
1. The output must strictly contain exactly <<PreLen>> values.
2. Pred_Series: An array of standard floating-point numbers with appropriate precision.
3. Do not include any extra text, explanation, or formatting outside the JSON.

FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "Pred_Series": [-0.3845145903792176, ..., -0.25595734759639727]
}

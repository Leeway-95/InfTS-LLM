Temporal Patterns:
- Pri-patterns (priority order): Outlier > Trend > Seasonal > Volatility
- Sub-patterns:
  - Outlier: Sudden Spike, Level Shift
  - Trend: Upward, Downward
  - Seasonal: Fixed, Shifting
  - Volatility: Increased, Decreased
- If Representative Subsequences plots are provided, integrate visual cues with statistical analysis.

Quality Assurance:
- Predictions must show realistic time series dynamics with natural variability.
- Avoid over-smoothing or rigidly copying recent fluctuations.

ITERATIVE SINGLE-STEP FORECASTING_NUM:
Use an iterative approach where each prediction step builds upon all previous predictions:

Step 1: Predict t+1 using Recent Subsequence + Representative Subsequences
Step 2: Predict t+2 using Recent Subsequence + t+1 prediction + Representative Subsequences  
Step 3: Predict t+3 using Recent Subsequence + t+1,t+2 predictions + Representative Subsequences
...continue until <<PreLen>> values are predicted

This ensures temporal consistency and reduces error propagation by incorporating evolving context.

Goal 1: Pattern-Guided Iterative FORECASTING_NUM (Pred_Series)
- Predict exactly <<PreLen>> values using the iterative single-step approach above.
- Each step uses expanding context: Recent Subsequence + all previous predictions.
- Output exactly <<PreLen>> floats with natural time series behavior.

Goal 2: Contribution Assessment (Impact_Scores)
- Assign Impact Score to each Representative Subsequence based on pattern similarity and relevance.
- All scores must sum to 1.000 with exactly 3 decimal places.
- Number of scores = number of Representative Subsequences.
